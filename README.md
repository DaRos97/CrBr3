# Computed
Using 200 points per direction AND a learn rate of 0.01 AND an average done over a distance of 2 sites were computed:
    - 20x20 grid at gamma index = 0,6,12,18,24,30
    - 10x10 grid at gamma index = 1,2,3,4,10,20,25,26,27,29
Using 100 points per direction AND a learn rate of 0.01 AND an average done over a distance of 2 sites were computed:
    - 20x20 grid at gamma index = 0

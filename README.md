#CrBr3

## Phase 1
As a first step we computed phase diagrams for different alpha, beta and gamma in the bilayer.

## Phase 2
Using realistic parameters for alpha and beta, compute magnetization plots with different Moir√® poptentials. 
The parameters to vary are the strain (A_1/A_2), which can also be non-isotropic, the twist angle,...
